        My name is Rahul Patil, and I'm a full-stack software engineer who's always chasing the latest tech trends. I'm fluent in ReactJS, MySQL, ASP.NET, and Machine Learning - so basically, I speak both human and machine languages.
        <br></br> <br></br>
        And when it comes to prompt engineering, I've had some great teachers - ChatGPT and Midjourney have taught me everything I know about making machines sound like they're almost as smart as me.
